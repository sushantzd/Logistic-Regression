# Logistic-Regression
Classification Project with Hyperparameter Tuning

In this project, I prepared a dataset for classification tasks using scikit-learn. The primary focus was on implementing logistic regression to build a predictive model. Key steps in this project include:

* Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure it was suitable for classification.
  
* Logistic Regression: Implemented logistic regression as the base model to classify the data.
  
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search CV to optimize the model's hyperparameters, enhancing its performance and accuracy.
  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a classification model, from data preparation to hyperparameter tuning, leveraging powerful techniques in machine learning.
